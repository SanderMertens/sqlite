# sqlite
SQLite binding for Cortex

# Contributing

This project depends on a Cortex environment.

Install the sqlite3 development library:

On Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
```

Run `source configure` from the Cortex folder (you need to be on the same directory!).

Now, from this project's folder, run `make`.
